Hey! I am a Ph.D. student at the University of Bonn and a student researcher at Google. I am interested in **scalable, principled** methods for analyzing graph data.

You can find more about my work on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.de/citations?hl=en&user=hssTYQMAAAAJ) and [personal website](http://tsitsul.in/). Follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/tsitsulin_) to get the latest updates.
